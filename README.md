This is a simple, clean landing page with a sticky, on-scroll header, built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It’s based on a Photoshop mockup called **[Solo - Modern Personal Blog PSD Template](https://themeforest.net/item/solo-modern-personal-blog-template/20160517)** — purchased from [Envato/ThemeForest](https://themeforest.net/). The goal of this project is to turn a static design into accessible, modern code — and make it easy for anyone to customize or learn from. It’s mobile responsive and includes a CSS columns masonry layout and an accessible, responsive navbar.

_This project is free and open-source, and focused on helping new frontend developers practice HTML, CSS and JavaScript with real-world examples._
